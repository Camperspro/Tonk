â€¢A player wins by removing all cards from their hand, or dropping with the lowest total card score. (â™  = 1 | JðŸ‚», QðŸ‚­, KðŸ‚® = 10) 
â€¢At the end of each turn, choose one card to place onto the grave. The last card on the grave can be picked up.
â€¢Lose cards by either spreading, or hitting another players spread. Getting hit by someone else will skip you for one turn.
â€¢Spreads occur when 3 cards form a combo EX: (â™£3,â™¦3,â™¥3,+) or (â™¥2,â™¥3,â™¥4,+) These are all the basics!
